# SharpSharks

SharpSharks is a simple web-based math game I created to give my kids some
"less-boring" math practice.

## Goal
You are an early morning diver.  Your goal is to get to your breakfast before
the hungry shark does!  The shark swims along steadily toward your breakfast.
You must answer math problems correctly to move forward.  Think quick!

## Installation
SharpSharks runs in a browser.  You can use it without a web server however.
Just download from the "Download Zip" button on this site, unzip, and open
`index.html` in your browser.

## Usage
Once you have SharpSharks "installed", pick your operation (addition,
subtraction, or muliplication) and your range of operands in the `Settings`
dialog (click the little wheel icon in the lower right).  You can also set
the time it takes the shark to make it across the course.

Once you have the settings the way you want, click `Start` and save your
breakfast!
